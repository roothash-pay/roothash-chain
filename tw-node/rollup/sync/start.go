// Package sync is responsible for reconciling L1 and core.
//
// The Ethereum chain is a DAG of blocks with the root block being the genesis block. At any given
// time, the head (or tip) of the chain can change if an offshoot/branch of the chain has a higher
// total difficulty. This is known as a re-organization of the canonical chain. Each block points to
// a parent block and the node is responsible for deciding which block is the head and thus the
// mapping from block number to canonical block.
//
// The Optimism (core) chain has similar properties, but also retains references to the Ethereum (L1)
// chain. Each core block retains a reference to an L1 block (its "L1 origin", i.e. L1 block
// associated with the epoch that the core block belongs to) and to its parent core block. The core chain
// node must satisfy the following validity rules:
//
//  1. l2block.number == l2block.l2parent.block.number + 1
//  2. l2block.l1Origin.number >= l2block.l2parent.l1Origin.number
//  3. l2block.l1Origin is in the canonical chain on L1
//  4. l1_rollup_genesis is an ancestor of l2block.l1Origin
//
// During normal operation, both the L1 and core canonical chains can change, due to a re-organisation
// or due to an extension (new L1 or core block).
//
// In particular, in the case of L1 extension, the core unsafe head will generally remain the same,
// but in the case of an L1 re-org, we need to search for the new safe and unsafe core block.
